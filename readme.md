### Description
Hazmat is a game about tradeoffs, it will show players how every choice they
make will potentially kill or save them. The concept can be categorized into
the survival genre - everything out there is trying to kill the player, and
they’ll have to make choices about where to go, what to do and what to use 
to survive. The player’s energy is constantly being drained by the actions 
they perform. Every action has different cost, so players have to think twice 
about their actions. The unforgivingness of the game, combined with a 
procedurally generated map, should allow for a lot of replayability. 
Players are able to try different strategies every time.
